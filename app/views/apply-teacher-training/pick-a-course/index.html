      <p>Candidates using Apply need to choose a course to apply to.</p>

      <p>If a candidate doesn’t know what course to apply to, give them a route to Find to begin or resume their search.</p>

      <p>Otherwise provide autocomplete features for picking the provider and course. The autocomplete shouldn’t depend on course and provider codes, but if a candidate enters them they should work too.</p>

      <p>We’ll need to amend this design to include training locations too – some courses offer multiple locations that a candidate can choose between. For example national SCITTs or school direct providers working with many schools.</p>

      <p>Users coming directly from Find could have a course pre-populated or added using a different flow, this hasn’t been designed yet.</p>
