      <p>UCAS keeps contact details for the following purposes:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>fraud</li>
        <li>finance</li>
        <li>web-link details (downtime, changes, etc)</li>
        <li>correspondent for UCAS monthly bulletins, etc</li>
        <li>new application alerts</li>
        <li>recipient of GT12 letter responses from successful applicants</li>
      </ul>

      <p>From what we know, UCAS haven’t collected permission to share these contacts with us. This means that because of GDPR they can’t give us any contact details containing personally identifiable information.</p>

      <p>The interface for seeing and editing these contact details is going away in UCAS. DfE is becoming responsible for them.</p>

      <p>We need to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>capture these details for new providers</li>
        <li>allow existing providers to set new contacts</li>
        <li>indicate to providers that they can request existing information from UCAS</li>
        <li>request permission to share details with UCAS</li>
        <li>share details with UCAS via the API</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We don’t know if UCAS is willing to request permission from providers to share existing contacts with DfE.</p>

      <p>UTT Correspondent is being captured as UCAS Correspondent.</p>

      <p>The UCAS correspondent will also be used as the web-link contact.</p>

      <p>The application alerts contact is captured if a user asks to receive alerts.</p>

      <p>The recipient of the GT12 responses is knowingly missing. It needs to be added.</p>

      <p>Telephone numbers have been removed. We only need to capture emails.</p>
