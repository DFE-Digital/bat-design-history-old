      <p>Move age range from an optional question on the subject page to a required question on its own page.</p>
      <p>We’re making this mandatory as providers need to indicate the age range to candidates:</p>

      <blockquote class="govuk-inset-text govuk-!-margin-left-0">
        <p>Providers should specify in their recruitment literature and programme design documentation the age range of training for each of their programmes. Trainees should be assessed as meeting the standards in the specified age range.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Provide a list of the most common age ranges as published on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-criteria/initial-teacher-training-itt-criteria-and-supporting-advice#c22-age-ranges">ITT criteria and supporting advice</a>:</p>
      <blockquote class="govuk-inset-text govuk-!-margin-left-0">
        <p>Training must enable trainees to acquire the knowledge and skills they need to teach within the phase for which they are training. Typically training will take place across the following age ranges:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>3 to 7, 5 to 11, or 7 to 11 for primary training</li>
          <li>7 to 14 for middle training</li>
          <li>11 to 16, 11 to 18, or 14 to 19 for secondary training, depending on the subjects of training</li>
        </ul>

        <p>No training programme should cover fewer than 4 school years.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>We can’t easily map existing UCAS data to age range. We should ask for it again for all courses.</p>
