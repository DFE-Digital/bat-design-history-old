  <p>When users are registered they receive this welcome email. Weâ€™ve found that users would refer to this email when they want to return to our service. By using this email to click through to DfE Sign-in the user has no easy route out to our service.</p>

  <p>To solve this we will send our own welcome email and request that this version of the email be suppressed.</p>
