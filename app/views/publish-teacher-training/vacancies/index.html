      <p>We donâ€™t know how providers use vacancies yet. This design assumes that closing a course (eg there are no vacancies at any training location) is the most common action.</p>

      <p>The design for editing vacancies must account for the following scenarios:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a course with one training location</li>
        <li>a part time or full time course with one training location</li>
        <li>a course with many training locations</li>
        <li>a part time or full time course with many training locations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Vacancies could sit within a course, alongside the enrichment fields, or separate to it. If vacancies were alongside enrichment then either; vacancies would need to be published after editing; or vacancies would behave differently to the other form. For this reason vacancies has been put elsewhere, and the design tries to make it clear that these changes will be immediate.</p>
