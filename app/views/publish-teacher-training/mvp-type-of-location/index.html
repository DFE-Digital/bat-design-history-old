      <p>A quick way to indicate if a location is an area or an address.</p>

      <p>Some providers use the UCAS training locations to indicate a region or area, eg United Learning Sussex.</p>

      <p>When we validate locations we require building and street name, town or city, and postcode. For regions or areas this validation isnâ€™t appropriate. However we still need enough information to show courses on a map.</p>

      <p>In the design below, if a user selects An area, then we would validate differently.</p>
