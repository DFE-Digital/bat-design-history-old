# Document GOV.UK designs and prototypes

A place for documenting designs based on the GOV.UK prototyping kit.

## Take screenshots

### Configure

In [scripts/screenshot.js](scripts/screenshot.js) you should set:
* the domain you want to capture (eg a locally running prototype at localhost:3000 or an Heroku app)
* the paths on that domain with the titles you want to give them

Example paths:
```js
paths = [
  { title: 'Index page', path: '/'},
  { title: 'Terms and conditions', path: '/terms-conditions'}
]
```

### Run

```bash
node scripts/screenshot.js "A generated example"
```

This will:
* visit each page and save a screenshot
* save screenshots in a new directory
* generate an index page with screenshots listed in order

Example output:
```
node scripts/screenshot.js "A generated example"
Index generated: app/views/a-generated-example/index.html
https://design-history.herokuapp.com/
 >> app/assets/images/a-generated-example/design-history-index.png
```

[Example commit](/commit/eba8f4fbcb11e3f50b3084711ad9f90ebc59898e), [example page](https://design-history.herokuapp.com/a-generated-example).

### Document

When the index page and images are generated itâ€™s easy to begin documenting those designs.

### Publish

You can easily publish your design history to Heroku to create a linkable, shareable design artefact.
